# Joint curation session

During this session we will curate a couple of variants in a joint session. 

Each of you will get to look at the variant and decide if you think it is a true or false variant. 

Then we will have a poll to see what the consensus is in the group. 

### Some simple curation considerations:

    - Variant allele fraction (VAF)?
    - Total coverage?
    - Variant coverage?
    - Variant detected in the normal DNA?
    - Repetitive DNA?
    - Mappability and mapping qualities?
    - Base quality?
    - Support from reads in both directions?
    - Is it a lot of variation in the region?
    - Sign of misalignment?
    - ....

- In IGV, open up the following bam files
    - Exome_Tumor_sorted_mrkdup_bqsr.bam
    - Exome_Norm_sorted_mrkdup_bqsr.bam
